            <p class="lead text-muted">I believe kids learn best with a solid curriculum, personal coaching, and parental involvement. With my help, YOU can help your child learn music. Let's get started! </p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Curriculum</h2>
            <p class="lead text-muted">Kodály Kids is a 12-week beginner music course. You know what you're getting right from the start! At the end of 12 weeks, your child will be familiar with reading, writing, and singing pentatonic melodies and basic rhythmic patterns. Don't know what that means yet? That's okay! Each week we'll have a 45 minute lesson where you AND your child get to learn and play together with clear objectives and homework, so you don't have to wonder where to start when it's time to practice.</p>

            <p class="lead text-muted">This is a Kodály-based music curriculum. That means we'll learn music through singing and playing folk songs and games. Many cultures around the world have based their folk music off of the same musical sounds. Your child will learn to recognize and replicate these musical patterns as they build a strong musical foundation for future success. Not only that, kids LOVE these songs and games - that's why they've stuck around for so long!</p>
            <h2 class=section-header>Personal Coaching</h2>
            <p class="lead text-muted">You get virtual face-to-face lessons with an expert music educator from the comfort of your own home! I know music is something we practice all week long, so when you need help during the week I'm available too. As my student, you have daily access to a personal coach who can listen to you practice and demonstrate rhythms, melodies, and games so you don't miss a beat. Even though our 12 weeks together will have to end, you'll be added to my personal support group so you can keep your music skills sharp.</p>
            <h2 class="section-header">Parental Involvement</h2>
            <p class="lead text-muted">Gone are the days where parents had to sit and watch their child in music lessons, or worse yet, sit out in the car. In our lessons, YOU are my student as much as your child is. You get to sing and play games and instruments right along with us, and when it comes time to practice you won't have to say "I don't know" when your child asks, "what does THAT mean?" Music isn't just more fun together, it's also a special bonding experience for you and your children.</p>
