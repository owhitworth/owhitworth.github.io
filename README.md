# Homeschool Music Literacy

WELCOME TO KOD√ÅLY KIDS HOMESCHOOL MUSIC ACADEMY!
We specialize in helping excited children learn music. True music education is unavailable to so many kids, and we want every child to have the opportunity to integrate music in their life.

## Description

This proven system helps homeschooled children learn musical patterns SO WELL they can recreate them and make their own music (without sitting and staring at the notes on a piano every day).
This is a 12 week program for Homeschool students to learn to read, write, and sing/play beginning music rhythms and melodies.
